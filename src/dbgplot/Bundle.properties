OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    To use:\n\n\t1)  Start a debugging session\n\t2) Select the menu option Window/Debugging/Plotter\n\t3) Paste and enter the name of a variable that is into the textfield at the bottom.\n\t\t\n\
    The variable must be in scope and be an array or List<?\
    >.\n\
    The elements in the array need to either be convertible to double  or have a field that is convertable to double.\n\
    It may be helpful to resize. \n\
    One can zoom in by dragging a selection rectangle in the plot panel.\n\
    After zooming use the fit plot to see the full plot again.\n\
    If multiple variables are plotted the split button toggles between having\nthe plots overlaid on each other or split into vertically stacked panels.\n\
    It has only been tested when debugging Java. \
    It might work when debugging \nother languages but only if that debugger was implemented via JDPA Debugger.
